# CAT (Calculatron and Algebra Tutor)
Created at the culminating project for my Programming Languages class, this F# project implements an interpreter for a programming language that evaluates complex algebraic expressions
and outputs a series of simplifications for the expression. In addition to printing out a textual representation of these steps, the interpreter will produce a LaTeX file that can be compiled
in order to produce a pdf which displays the simplification steps in an aesthetically pleasing form. For more information about the project and if you would like to run a program, see
the full [docs/specification.pdf](specification.pdf)
