 - Update docs about decimal points
 + Add implicit multiplication for variables
 + Make exponentiation (maybe its actually multiplication?) include parens when negative is in exponent
 + A distribute function that happens first (Make the simplify functions take an expand flag)
 + Add unit tests
 + Add cases to combine multiplication like the ones I added to addition
 - Rework expression order to be a bit more consist
 + Check if I should add not expands
 - Division stuff
 - Allow factoring directly from exponentials
 + Add error checking to file writing
